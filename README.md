# SourceQ Engine

**Status:** Work **NOT** In Progress (Development has been stopped) 🚧  
**Type:** 3D Game Engine  
**Platform:** Windows (demo builds), future multi-platform support  
**Planned Games:** Quanto (2027), Prequel (TBA)  
**Repository Purpose:** Demo, architecture showcase, development progress  
**Source Code:** Closed / reworked version only

## Overview
**SourceQ Engine** is a 3D game engine currently under active development.  
It is designed to power games like the **Quanto** series and other future projects.

Core design goals:

- High-quality 3D rendering and lighting  
- Object physics and collisions  
- Level and map management  
- Demo camera for testing and visualization  
- Modular structure for game development

> ⚠️ All content in this repository is demo/concept only. Full source code remains closed.

## Features / Modules
| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Renderer** | Handles 3D graphics, shaders, lighting, and visual effects |
| **Physics** | Manages object dynamics, collisions, and basic simulation |
| **Lighting** | Scene lighting, bloom, and visual effects |
| **Maps/Levels** | Level and map management, loading/saving support |
| **Demo Camera** | Camera for observing and testing engine behavior |
| **Games** | Example games: Quanto, Prequel (planned) |

> Each module is designed to be modular and extendable. Demos illustrate their behavior without revealing full source code.
